Hey Visitor, 
I am glad you came here to see my work.
I have been working on a project of Employee management System with layered programming approach in which data layer is ready and infront of you.
For storage of data i have used file system lator on i will use it to MySql server.
In order to manage the data there are two diffrent files for designation and for details of employees in which i do operations with designationKey and employeeId respectively.
If you see a more optimised way of handling this code never forget to contribute.
